## Context
Managing local context, caching, and performance optimization

## Requirements
1. Context Management:
   - Prioritize local context over external sources
   - Implement context window optimization
   - Handle context switching efficiently
   - Maintain context history

2. Caching Strategy:
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement versioned caching
   - Clear cache every 24 hours
   - Track cache hit/miss rates

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Minimize context switches
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Reduce API calls
   - Monitor resource utilization

4. Security Considerations:
   - Validate context sources
   - Secure cache storage
   - Implement access controls
   - Log context operations

5. Integration:
   - Coordinate with MCP servers
   - Sync with OpenRouter
   - Update DeepLucid context
   - Handle fallbacks

## Implementation
1. Set up context manager
2. Configure caching system
3. Implement security checks
4. Enable monitoring
5. Track performance metrics
