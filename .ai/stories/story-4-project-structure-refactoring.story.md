# Epic-2: UI Modernization and Component Library

# Story-4: Project Structure Refactoring and Best Practices Implementation

## Story Description

**As a** developer
**I want** to refactor the project structure and implement consistent patterns
**so that** the codebase is more maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices

## Status

In Progress

## Context

Following the implementation of authentication (Story-1), UI components (Story-2), and during the development of profile management (Story-3), we've identified several areas that need standardization and refactoring. This story focuses on implementing consistent patterns, improving the project structure, and establishing best practices across the codebase.
