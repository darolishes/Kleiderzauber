# Epic-2: UI Modernization and Component Library

# Story-4: Project Structure Refactoring and Best Practices Implementation

## Story Description

**As a** developer
**I want** to refactor the project structure and implement consistent patterns
**so that** the codebase is more maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices

## Status

In Progress

## Context

Following the implementation of authentication (Story-1), UI components (Story-2), and during the development of profile management (Story-3), we've identified several areas that need standardization and refactoring. This story focuses on implementing consistent patterns, improving the project structure, and establishing best practices across the codebase.

   2. - [ ] Implement feature-based structure where appropriate
   3. - [x] Create shared utilities directory
   4. - [ ] Document directory structure standards
   5. - [ ] Update import aliases

4. - [x] Enhance Build Configuration

   1. - [x] Optimize Vite configuration
   2. - [x] Review and update PostCSS setup
   3. - [x] Configure proper build optimizations
   4. - [x] Document build process

5. - [ ] Implement Testing Standards

   1. - [ ] Set up consistent test patterns
   2. - [ ] Add test utilities and helpers
   3. - [ ] Create test documentation
   4. - [ ] Add test coverage requirements

6. - [ ] Create Development Guidelines
   1. - [ ] Document coding standards
   2. - [ ] Create component creation guidelines
   3. - [ ] Set up PR templates
   4. - [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Progress Summary

Completed:

- Export pattern standardization in auth and profile components
- CSS architecture optimization with proper dark mode support
- Theme switching implementation with system preference detection
- Toast notification system migration to shadcn/ui
- Build configuration enhancement with Vite and PostCSS
- CSS variables organization and documentation
- Shared utilities directory setup

In Progress:

- Feature-based structure implementation
- Directory structure standards
- Testing infrastructure setup

Remaining:

- Development guidelines creation
- Testing standards implementation
- Import alias optimization

## Recent Updates

### March 21, 2024

- Completed CSS architecture optimization
- Implemented theme switching with system preference detection
- Migrated toast notifications to shadcn/ui
- Added comprehensive CSS documentation
- Created modular CSS structure with proper separation of concerns
- Implemented smooth theme transitions
- Added persistent theme preferences

## Next Steps

1. Focus on implementing feature-based structure
2. Set up testing infrastructure
3. Document directory standards
4. Create development guidelines

## Dependencies

- None (refactoring existing code)

## Notes

The CSS architecture and theme implementation are now complete and following best practices. The focus should shift to implementing feature-based structure and setting up testing infrastructure.
