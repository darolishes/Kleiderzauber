# Active Context: 2025-03-21

## Current Focus

- Project structure refactoring and standardization
- Documentation of best practices and patterns
- Preparation for feature-based architecture

## Recent Decisions

1. Export Pattern Standard

   - Using named exports consistently across components
   - Avoiding default exports for better maintainability
   - Pattern: `export { ComponentName }`
   - Successfully implemented in auth and profile components

2. CSS Configuration

   - Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
   - darkMode enabled with "class" strategy
   - Proper content configuration for all relevant files
   - CSS variables for theming

3. Project Structure
   - Moving towards feature-based organization
   - Standardizing component patterns
   - Implementing consistent documentation

## Current Challenges

1. Component Export Consistency

   - Need to implement ESLint rules
   - Documentation pending
   - Review remaining components

2. CSS Architecture

   - Documentation needed
   - Best practices guide pending
   - Pattern enforcement strategy needed

3. Project Organization
   - Feature-based structure planning
   - Directory reorganization pending
   - Import alias optimization needed

## Environment State

- Node dependencies up to date
- Build cache cleaned
- Development server running with latest configuration
- CSS and component exports standardized
