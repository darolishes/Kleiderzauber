# Active Context: 2024-03-22

## Current Focus

- Story-6: Wardrobe Item Management Foundation
- Task: Test-First Implementation Setup

## Recent Decisions

1. Story Structure:

   - Implemented test-first approach documentation
   - Defined comprehensive test coverage requirements
   - Created detailed test plan structure
   - Established clear implementation dependencies

2. Technical Planning:
   - Defined Supabase schema for clothing items
   - Planned Zustand store structure
   - Outlined component hierarchy
   - Set performance requirements

## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring comprehensive test coverage before implementation
2. Managing image processing and storage efficiently
3. Implementing responsive UI for various device sizes
4. Maintaining performance with image-heavy operations

## Next Actions

1. Set up test infrastructure for Story-6
2. Create initial test files structure
3. Implement database schema tests
4. Begin component test suite development

## Dependencies

- Story-3: User Profile Management (Required)
- Story-4: Project Structure (Required)
- Supabase for backend and storage
- Zustand for state management
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Jest for unit testing
- Playwright for E2E testing

## Current Story

[Story-6: Wardrobe Item Management Foundation](../stories/story-6-wardrobe-item-management.story.md)

## Progress Status

- [x] Story documentation created
- [x] Test plan defined
