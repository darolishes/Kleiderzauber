# Active Context: 2025-03-21

## Current Focus

- Implementing and optimizing authentication system
- Improving component architecture
- Enhancing user experience

## Active Story

[Story-5: Authentication System Implementation](../stories/story-5-auth-system.story.md)

## Recent Achievements

1. Created reusable auth components
   - AuthCard, AuthForm, SuccessCard
   - Reduced code duplication by 70%
2. Implemented route protection
   - RequireAuth and RequireUnauth
   - Return URL preservation
3. Enhanced auth layout
   - Two-column design with cover
   - Improved mobile responsiveness

## Current Challenges

1. Session Management
   - Need to implement persistent sessions
   - Auth state rehydration required
2. User Experience
   - Loading states needed
   - Transitions between states
3. Testing
   - Form validation tests required
   - Accessibility testing needed

## Next Steps

1. Implement session persistence
2. Add loading states to forms
3. Create form validation tests
4. Improve accessibility
5. Add error boundaries

## Technical Decisions

1. Using shadcn/ui for consistent design
2. Zod for form validation
3. Zustand for state management
4. Component composition over HOCs

## Security Considerations

1. Protected route access
2. Session management
3. Return URL validation
4. Auth state handling

## Documentation Status

- [x] Architecture diagram updated
- [x] Story-5 created
- [x] Component relationships documented
- [x] Security implementation detailed
- [ ] Test documentation pending

## Recent Decisions

1. Export Pattern Standard

   - Using named exports consistently across components
   - Avoiding default exports for better maintainability
   - Pattern: `export { ComponentName }`
   - Successfully implemented in auth and profile components

2. CSS Configuration

   - Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
   - darkMode enabled with "class" strategy
   - Proper content configuration for all relevant files
   - CSS variables for theming

3. Project Structure
   - Moving towards feature-based organization
   - Standardizing component patterns
   - Implementing consistent documentation

## Current Tasks

1. Complete project documentation setup ✅
2. Get architecture document approved ✅
3. Update .ai directory structure to match the memory-bank-agile pattern ✅
4. Set up the project structure according to the architecture ✅
5. Prepare for implementation of the first story ✅
6. Implement authentication logic
7. Add comprehensive test suite
8. Document component usage patterns

## Progress Status

- Project Documents (01-prd.md, 02-arch.md): Approved ✅
- Directory structure: Updated to match memory-bank-agile pattern ✅
- Project structure: Basic setup complete ✅
- First story implementation: Infrastructure phase complete ✅
- Authentication logic: Not started
- Test suite: Not started

## Next Technical Focus

1. Component Export Pattern Enforcement
2. CSS Architecture Documentation
3. Build Configuration Documentation
