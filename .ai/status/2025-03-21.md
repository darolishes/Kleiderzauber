# Status Update - March 21, 2025

## Development Steps

[Timestamp: 03:42]

1. Analyzed current project structure:

   - Mapped dependencies and relationships

2. Created knowledge graph for tracking:
   - Documented current structure state
   - Mapped Story-4 requirements
   - Defined feature-based structure goals

[Timestamp: 03:55] 3. Implemented initial feature-based structure:

- Created features/ directory with auth, profile, wardrobe, and theme modules
- Set up shared/ directory for common components and utilities
- Created feature module type definitions and utilities
- Implemented auth feature module as example

[Timestamp: 04:05] 4. Migrated auth components to feature module:

- Moved login-form, register-form, and reset-password-form components

- Cleaned up old auth directory

[Timestamp: 04:15] 5. Migrated profile components to feature module:

- Moved Avatar and ProfileForm components
- Created profile-specific type definitions

[Timestamp: 05:05] 10. Fixed TypeScript module resolution: - Updated Vite config with wildcard patterns - Synchronized tsconfig.app.json path mappings - Created shared types directory - Implemented proper type exports

## Key Decisions

[Timestamp: 03:42]

- Will implement feature-based structure while maintaining utility directories

[Timestamp: 04:05]

- Moved auth components to maintain feature isolation
- Using component subdirectories for complex features
- Keeping flat structure for simple components
- Implementing consistent export patterns

[Timestamp: 04:15]

- Implemented consistent type sharing between features (auth types in profile)
- Using Pick utility type for type composition
- Maintaining clear separation of user data and preferences

[Timestamp: 04:25]

- Maintaining clean import paths
- Using barrel files for simplified imports

[Timestamp: 04:55]

- Created comprehensive path alias system
- Using @features, @shared, @utils, etc. for clear imports
- Maintaining consistent import patterns across codebase
- Simplified relative path complexity

[Timestamp: 05:05]

- Added wildcard patterns to Vite config for better path resolution
- Synchronized path mappings across all config files
- Centralized shared types in types directory
- Using consistent type export patterns

## Next Steps

[Last Updated: 05:05]

1. Document new import standards
2. Create migration guide for existing code
3. Review and test all component imports
4. Set up ESLint rules for import patterns

- Need for consistent export pattern enforcement
- Potential for similar import/export mismatches in other components
- CSS configuration could benefit from better documentation
- Project structure needs optimization for scalability
