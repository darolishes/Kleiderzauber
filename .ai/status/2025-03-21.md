### Component Relationships

#### Router Layer

- App.tsx: Main application router
- RequireAuth: Protects authenticated routes
- RequireUnauth: Prevents authenticated access to auth pages

#### Authentication Components

- AuthLayout: Two-column layout with cover image
- AuthCard: Consistent card styling
- AuthForm: Base form functionality
- SuccessCard: Success state display
- Form Components: Login, Register, Reset Password

#### State Management

- AuthStore: Authentication state and methods

#### Navigation

- Protected Routes: Require authentication
- Auth Pages: Login, Register, Reset
- Return URL: Preserves intended destination

### Data Flow

1. User attempts to access protected route
2. RequireAuth checks authentication state
3. If not authenticated:
   - Store return URL
   - Redirect to login
4. On successful auth:
   - Update AuthStore
   - Update UserStore
   - Redirect to return URL

### Security Implementation

1. Route Protection
   - RequireAuth for protected routes
   - RequireUnauth for auth pages
2. Session Management
   - AuthStore maintains session state
   - Proper auth state rehydration
3. Navigation Security
   - Return URL validation
   - Protected route verification
