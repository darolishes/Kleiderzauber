# Status Update: 2025-03-21

## Development Steps

1. `.ai/project/01-prd.md`: Project Requirements Document created and approved

   - Defined project scope, features, and requirements
   - Outlined 5 epics for the project implementation
   - Established the initial set of stories for Epic-1

2. `.ai/project/02-arch.md`: Architecture document created and approved

   - Defined technical architecture and patterns
   - Created data models for User, ClothingItem, and Outfit
   - Established project structure and guidelines

3. `.ai/project/03-structure.md`: Project structure defined

   - Outlined folder organization and naming conventions
   - Defined component structure and patterns
   - Established import conventions

4. `.ai/stories/story-1-user-registration-login.story.md`: First story defined

   - Created detailed implementation plan for authentication
   - Defined tasks with TDD approach
   - Established data models and UI components needed

5. `.ai`: Directory structure reorganized
   - Aligned with memory-bank-agile pattern
   - Set up project, stories, status, and artifacts directories
   - Created proper file structure and naming conventions

## Key Decisions

- Decision 1: Using Supabase for authentication, database, and storage to simplify backend development
- Decision 2: Following the memory-bank-agile structure for project documentation
- Decision 3: Implementing authentication before other features as foundational step
- Decision 4: Using TDD approach for all implementation work

## Next Steps

1. Continue Project Initialization: Set up the basic folder structure based on architecture document
2. Prepare Story-1 Implementation: Configure test environment and define test cases
3. Begin development of authentication features with TDD approach
